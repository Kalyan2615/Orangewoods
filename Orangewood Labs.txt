This helps the model recognize objects in different conditions and variations.\n","\n","# Ans2: Number of Epochs:\n","# 300 epochs are used initially.\n","# The optimal number of epochs depends on the complexity of the dataset and model. You can monitor training and validation loss curves to determine when the model starts to overfit and adjust epochs accordingly.\n","\n","# Ans3: Hyperparameters:\n","# Image Size (s=640): Adjust based on your dataset and hardware constraints. Larger images capture more details but require more processing power.\n","# Batch Size (batch_size=16): This controls the number of images processed in each training iteration. Experiment to find a balance between training speed and memory usage.\n","# Learning Rate (learning_rate=0.001): This controls how quickly the model updates its weights based on training errors. Experiment with different rates to find an optimal value for convergence.\n","# Optimizer (optimizer=torch.optim.Adam): This algorithm optimizes the model's weights. Other optimizers like SGD can also be explored.\n","\n","# Ans4: Output Metrics:\n","# The results dictionary returned by the model.train() function typically includes:\n","# Mean Average Precision (mAP): A common metric for object detection, measuring the model's ability to correctly detect and localize objects.\n","# Precision and Recall: Additional metrics to analyze detection accuracy and completeness.\n","# Loss: Training and validation loss curves can be visualized to monitor convergence and diagnose potential issues.\n","# The specific metrics and their values will depend on your dataset and training configuration. Include the concrete results you obtain in your Colab notebook to demonstrate model performance."]}]}
